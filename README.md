SnapNuke
========

A pretty malicious tool to bomb a Snapchat account with floods of Snaps.

**Snapchat is such a popular app, why is this possible?**
Sadly Snapchat isn't really designed to "Not" do this, meaning that the flaw is in the design of snapchat itself. The app is there to allow users to send a bunch of snaps to other users without any problems or restrictions. This piece of code pretty much just manipulates that and jumps around a few of the checks that Snapchat did put into place. The biggest issue on Snapchats end is the fact that their Encryption Keys and Tokens are easily obtainable through APK decompilation and online references to their Encryption process. Further documentation to that stuff can be found on someone else's github if thats what you are interested in. If you are curious about any of this, don't hesitate to ask, happy bombing ;)
